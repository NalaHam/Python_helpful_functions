#expressions

% called modulus gives remainders after division
ex: 8%3 = 2 because 8/3 = 6 * (2/3)

// called floor divison gives closest whole number of divison
ex: 7//3 = 2 and 27//157890 = 0

x += 3 is the same as x = x + 3 

== is equal to
!= is not equal to 

32//8 == 32.0/8 is TRUE because 4 = 4.0


#sep and end

print("Hello",'World', 1)             # will print Hello World 1
print("Hello",'World', 1, sep='_')    # will print Hello_World_1
print("Hello",'World', 1, sep='taco') # will print HellotacoWorldtaco1
print("Hello",'World', 1, sep='')     # will print HelloWorld1
print("Hello",'World', 1, sep=' ')    # the default behavior


for i in range(5):
print(i,end="")       # will print 01234
